# RecyclerView with Groupie
This repository shows how to implement a RecyclerView using the Groupie library. There're two branches, master and normal-item, in the first one there's an expansive item example, and in the second one, normal items.

Using expanded items available in Groupie, a number list is shown into the MainActivity. Any interaction with any item will be colapsed/expanded.
